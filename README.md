# Future-Project-Ideas
This is a repository for ideas of little web apps that I want to make and require a little challenge to them 

# Pokemon Catch Calculator 
this idea will be for all 7 gens of pokemon, and it will basically take an input of stats and with that I will
apply the equations the various games use 

Android App incoming 


# Javascript Games, Java Games
self explanatory, but simple mobile games like flappy bird, agar.io, etc.
eventually create my own games with some practice

# Key Identifier in music
This will be an app that given some chords, and/or notes, it will guess a key. 
This will be exceptionally diffucult because of a few reasons
1. determining different keys from say A minor and C major because they have the same notes
2. Some people will mostly be in one key, but then use a passing chord, or passing riff, not in the key to give it chromatic interest 
think of imagine by John Lennon
3. Just so many chords that I will have to list unless I find a better method 


Definitely want to create an android app for this 

# 1 rep max calculator for weightlifting
this will just take a given lift, and given number of reps, and calculate a projected 1 rep max
Bonus points for showing the other percentages

finished this one at this link https://github.com/anoobishnoob/oneRepMaxCalculator-C-Sharp
now if I can show the other percentages that will be pretty cool as well.

I want to create an android app for this now
